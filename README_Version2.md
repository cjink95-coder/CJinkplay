# CJINKAT — Static HTML/CSS starter

This is a minimal static site scaffold for CJINKAT.

Included files
- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/main.js

Images to add (place inside an `images/` folder)
- images/hero.jpg            ← use Image 1 (tattoo-in-bathtub) as hero background
- images/cjink-logo.png      ← use Image 2 (avatar), circular PNG produced with the commands below
- images/cjink-logo-512.png  ← optional 2x logo for retina (recommended)

How to preview
1. Place files in a folder (index.html, css/, js/, images/).
2. Open index.html in a browser (or serve with a static server).

Accessibility & behavior
- All external links include rel="noopener noreferrer".
- Gallery images are keyboard-focusable. Lightbox supports ESC to close.
- Booking form opens a prefilled WhatsApp conversation.

Customizations
- Replace text, social links, and images as needed.
- Edit colors in css/styles.css if you want a different palette.

If you want, I can:
- Produce the processed logo PNG and favicon for you (if you upload the full-resolution Image 2),
- Zip these files for direct download,
- Or push to a GitHub repository if you provide owner/name.
